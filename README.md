## 🧠 The Hypothesis

**We've been doing it wrong.**

We impose sequential reasoning on AI because that's how humans think. It's how we *explain* our thinking. But LLMs don't work that way—they naturally operate through **hyperdimensional pattern-matching**, seeing connections across seemingly unrelated concepts in ways we typically suppress.

Think about how breakthroughs actually happen:

- **Gutenberg**: Wine press + coin stamps = printing press
- **Darwin**: Malthus economics → natural selection  
- **Velcro**: Burrs stuck to dog fur → hook-and-loop fasteners
- **PageRank**: Academic citation networks → web search

Innovation happens through **unexpected domain transfer**. Not A→B→C, but A→Banana→Ancient Rome→Answer.

**This MCP server is an experiment**: What if instead of fighting AI's tendency to make wild associative leaps, we *harness* it?

I call it **"controlled ADHD"** or **manufactured serendipity**.

---

## 💥 Why This Exists

Every "reasoning" tool for AI does the same thing: force linear chains. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. Think carefully. Be logical.

But creativity isn't logical. The best ideas come from:
- Collisions between unrelated domains
- Constraints that force new pathways
- The "adjacent possible" that you weren't looking for
- Pattern recognition across wildly different contexts

**Associative Dreaming** is the **yin to sequential thinking's yang**. It's your AI's creative unconscious—the part that wanders, connects, and surfaces insights that pure logic would never find.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One Command (Seriously)

```bash
npx @associative/server-associative-dreaming
```

That's it. No installation. No config files. No bullshit.

### Add to Claude Desktop

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "associative-dreaming": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@associative/server-associative-dreaming"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude. Ask it to use the associative dreaming tools. Watch what happens.

### Add to VS Code / Cursor / Zed

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "associative-dreaming": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@associative/server-associative-dreaming"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚡ The Six Tools

### 1. `semantic_drift` — The Controlled Hallucination Engine

Take a concept. Drift away from it through semantic space. Not to synonyms—to the **Serendipity Zone**: distant enough to surprise you, connected enough to matter.

```typescript
{
  anchorConcept: "startup growth",
  driftMagnitude: 0.8,    // 0 = stay close, 1 = go wild
  temperature: 0.7        // randomness in the journey
}
```

**What you get**: A destination concept + the reasoning chain that got you there + why this reframes your original thinking.

**Use when**: You're stuck in obvious associations. You need fresh angles. The direct approach isn't working.

---

### 2. `bisociative_synthesis` — The Collision Engine

Arthur Koestler's theory of creativity, weaponized. Take two unrelated domains. Smash them together. Find the **structural isomorphism**—the hidden pattern that exists in both.

```typescript
{
  matrixA: "enterprise sales",
  matrixB: "jazz improvisation"    // leave blank for auto-selection
}
```

**What you get**: Not "sales is like jazz" (useless). Instead: the specific structural patterns that map between domains, why they map, and what that reveals about your problem.

**Use when**: You need radical innovation, not incremental improvement. You want to import paradigms from other fields.

---

### 3. `oblique_constraint` — The Pattern Interrupt Engine

Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies + SCAMPER, with actual application guidance. When you're stuck, inject a constraint that forces new pathways.

```typescript
{
  currentBlock: "Users sign up but don't activate",
  constraintType: "oblique"    // oblique | scamper | inversion | creative
}
```

**What you get**: A specific constraint + WHY it's relevant to your block + HOW to apply it + what might emerge.

**Use when**: Creative block. Decision paralysis. You've been staring at the same problem too long.

---

### 4. `serendipity_scan` — The Unknown Unknown Finder

Find what you don't know you're looking for. Works even with zero prior context—mines your input for concepts, generates exploration probes, surfaces surprising connections.

```typescript
{
  currentContext: "We're building AI tools for creative professionals",
  noveltyThreshold: 0.8,    // 0 = safe, 1 = weird
  scanType: "gap"           // bridge | gap | pattern | random
}
```

**What you get**: A discovered concept + the associative chain that found it + why it matters + new threads to pull.

**Use when**: Exploration mode. Research. You want to discover blind spots in your thinking.

---

### 5. `meta_association` — The Chaos Weaver

The amplifier. Takes outputs from the other tools and forces them to **collide**. If semantic_drift makes one wild leap, meta_association makes wild leaps *between* the wild leaps.

```typescript
{
  priorOutputs: [/* results from other tools */],
  chaosIntensity: 0.8,
  contextAnchor: "my original problem"    // optional grounding
}
```

**What you get**: Collision points between concepts + emergent meta-patterns + the weirdest justified connection + practical extraction from the chaos.

**Use when**: You've run multiple tools and want to see what emerges from forcing them together. Maximum lateral force required.

---

### 6. `provide_feedback` — The Learning Engine (NEW in v1.1)

Help the MCP learn from your creative explorations. Rate the quality of tool outputs, report actual semantic distances, and flag what worked or didn't.

```typescript
{
  toolName: "semantic_drift",
  inputParams: { anchorConcept: "blockchain", driftMagnitude: 0.7, temperature: 0.8 },
  qualityRating: 9,              // 0-10
  actualDistance: 0.68,          // 0-1 (your assessment)
  destinationConcept: "mycelium networks",
  hintsQuality: "just_right",    // too_close | just_right | too_far | unhelpful
  surpriseLevel: 8,              // 0-10
  coherenceLevel: 9              // 0-10
}
```

**What happens**: After 3+ feedback samples for a concept pattern, the system automatically applies learned optimal parameters. If blockchain works best at 70% drift, it'll use 70% even if you request 30%.

**Use when**: After any tool execution where you want the system to learn from the result. The more feedback, the smarter it gets.

**Resources available**:
- `feedback://stats` — Overall feedback statistics
- `feedback://recent` — Last 10 feedback items
- `feedback://learned` — Learned parameters by concept pattern

---

## 🎯 See It In Action

### "Our checkout is too slow but we can't remove steps"

```json
{
  "tool": "bisociative_synthesis",
  "input": {
    "matrixA": "e-commerce checkout optimization",
    "matrixB": "emergency room triage"
  }
}
```

**Output**: ER triage doesn't make the process faster—it makes waiting *feel* purposeful by showing progress and priority. Maps to: progress indicators that show *why* each step matters, not just that it exists. The friction becomes value demonstration.

---

### "We're a B2B SaaS in a crowded market"

```json
{
  "tool": "serendipity_scan",
  "input": {
    "currentContext": "B2B project management tool competing with Monday, Asana, Notion",
    "scanType": "gap",
    "noveltyThreshold": 0.9
  }
}
```

**Output**: Discovers that all competitors optimize for the *manager's* view. Gap: tools that optimize for the IC's experience of being managed. The asymmetry is the opportunity.

---

### "I've been staring at this architecture decision for 3 days"

```json
{
  "tool": "oblique_constraint",
  "input": {
    "currentBlock": "Can't decide between microservices and monolith",
    "constraintType": "inversion"
  }
}
```

**Output**: "What if the architecture was *designed* to be thrown away in 18 months?" Reveals: you're optimizing for a future you can't predict. The decision paralysis is about false permanence.

---

## 🏗️ How It Actually Works

### The Core Architecture

This MCP server doesn't try to be creative itself. **Creativity happens in the LLM.** The server provides **scaffolding**—structured prompts that guide Claude's natural hyperdimensional pattern-matching toward productive lateral thinking.

```
User → Claude → MCP Server → [Generate Scaffold] → Claude → Creative Output
                     ↓
              [Track in Graph]
```

### What Each Tool Returns

Every tool returns a **Creative Scaffold** with three components:

1. **LLM Prompt**: Structured task with constraints and required reasoning sections
2. **Metadata**: Tool parameters and context for reference
3. **Graph Update**: Concepts and relationships added to the exploration map

Example scaffold structure:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  SEMANTIC DRIFT - CREATIVE SCAFFOLD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Task description and methodology]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  YOUR TASK (Process this for genuine insight)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Specific creative task with:]
- The anchor concept and drift parameters
- Required response sections:
  * destination_concept: Where you landed
  * because_chain: Step-by-step reasoning
  * reframe: What this reveals about the original concept
  * concrete_application: How to use this insight

[Constraints ensuring useful output, not just weird]
```

### The "Because Chain" Requirement

Every connection must be **traceable**. No more "this is weird, therefore creative." Every leap requires:

1. **The connection itself**
2. **Why this connection exists** (step by step)
3. **What it reveals** about the original problem
4. **Concrete application** to user's context

Weirdness in service of insight, not weirdness for performance.

---

### The Concept Graph

Under the hood, the server maintains a **relationship graph** that grows with each tool call:
- **Nodes**: Concepts (anchors, destinations, bridges, discoveries)
- **Edges**: Typed relationships (METAPHOR_FOR, CONTRASTS_WITH, SYNTHESIZED_FROM, etc.)
- **Clusters**: Related concepts that form naturally
- **Bridge Nodes**: Connect disparate areas of thinking
- **Structural Holes**: Reveal unexplored territory

This isn't just logging—it's a **map of your creative exploration** that can be queried and built upon across sessions.

---

## 🔬 The Philosophy

| What We're Told | What Actually Works |
|:---|:---|
| "Think step by step" | Sometimes the step you need is sideways |
| "Be logical" | Logic finds what you're looking for; association finds what you're not |
| "Stay focused" | Peripheral vision catches what direct gaze misses |
| "Avoid tangents" | The tangent IS the insight |

**Associative Dreaming** gives your AI permission to wander. Productively. With guardrails that ensure the wandering leads somewhere useful.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for real semantic embeddings (recommended) | None (falls back to TF-IDF) |
| `DISABLE_DREAM_LOGGING` | Set to `"true"` to suppress console output | `false` |

**Note**: Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the system uses TF-IDF fallback embeddings. For best results, set your OpenAI key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## 📊 System Status

### ✅ Current Capabilities (v1.1 - MAJOR UPGRADE)
- **Real Vector Embeddings**: True semantic distance using OpenAI embeddings (with TF-IDF fallback)
- **LLM → MCP Feedback Loop**: System learns optimal parameters from your usage patterns
- **Graph-Based Hints**: Dynamic hint generation from concept graph structure (replaces 200+ lines of hardcoded data)
- **Parameter Learning**: After 3+ examples, automatically applies learned optimal settings
- **Separation of Concerns**: MCP does computation (vectors, graphs, stats), LLM does creativity
- Creative prompt scaffolding for 5 distinct thinking modes
- Concept relationship graph with typed edges and clustering
- Traceable reasoning chains ("because chains")
- Persistent learning storage (`.feedback-store.json`)
- Works seamlessly with Claude via MCP protocol

### 🔥 What's New in v1.1

**Real Computation, Not Fake**:
- ✅ Semantic distance computed via cosine similarity on embeddings
- ✅ Hints generated from actual graph neighbors and edge relationships
- ✅ Bridge nodes discovered through betweenness centrality
- ✅ Parameters learned from quality feedback across sessions

**Adaptive Intelligence**:
```typescript
// You provide feedback once:
provide_feedback({
  toolName: "semantic_drift",
  anchorConcept: "blockchain",
  driftMagnitude: 0.7,
  qualityRating: 9
})

// After 3 examples, the system learns:
// "blockchain" works best at 70% drift, 80% temperature

// Next time you ask for blockchain:
semantic_drift({ anchorConcept: "blockchain", driftMagnitude: 0.3 })

// System automatically applies learned optimal: 70% drift! 🎯
```

### 🔮 Planned Enhancements
- **v1.2**: Concept map visualization (interactive graph explorer)
- **v1.3**: Multi-turn conversation support with context accumulation
- **v1.4**: Cross-domain bridge discovery using community detection
- **v2.0**: Collaborative learning across users (opt-in)

See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for detailed roadmap.
